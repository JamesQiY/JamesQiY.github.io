Players are first flooded with rules and instructions. They have to learn almost everything about the game just to start, let alone have fun.

All the information for the game is introduced right at the start and the players will have to gradually find comfort with the system. Various games will have various learning curves (just look at gloomhaven vs the mind), but if you want to play a bigger, bulkier, (and often prettier) game, then you are going to have to essentially study the rules for quite a while.

Instead of requiring the entire group to study the rules, only a single (or a few) person is needed to learn the bulk of the rules.

Rule books can't always rely on the reader to understand common terms like 'burn', 'banish', or 'mill', but a teacher from the group can use familiar terms to speed up the learning process.
