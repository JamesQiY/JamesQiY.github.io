Every word and punctuation symbol is understood to have a syntactic role in its sentence, such as nouns (denoting people, places or things), verbs (denoting actions), adjectives (which describe nouns) and adverbs (which describe verbs), just to name a few. Each word in a piece of text is therefore associated with a part-of-speech tag (usually assigned by hand), where the total number of tags can depend on the organization tagging the text."
